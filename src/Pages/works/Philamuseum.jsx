              ElasticSearch has played a crucial role in driving the dynamic
              content and search functionality of the philamuseum.org website.
              While it was primarily utilized as a search tool, it was also
              carefully calibrated to deliver content based on managed scoring
              and relevance. In addition, a combination of front-end and
              back-end API calls were developed to establish a predictive search
              feature.

              ElasticSearch was leveraged to support the calendar feature on the
              website. This involved utilizing its content aggregation, filter,
              and date range capabilities.

              From a technical standpoint, the object pages required a complete
              overhaul. The goal was to enable visitors to zoom in on the
              artwork and encourage them to learn more about it by presenting
              similar objects and additional information. I sourced the data
              from various outlets, with primary object data being obtained from
              Google FireStore through a Cloud Function. The images were served
              via a Micr.io IIIF image server, while ElasticSearch and Sanity.io
              CMS were utilized to manage additional content enhancements.
